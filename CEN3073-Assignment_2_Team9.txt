2. The software must allow for the pharmacy dispenser to modify the count of medication.
3. The software must create a log of the pharmacist and the prescriptions they dispensed. 
4. The software shall dispense exactly the amount of medication listed on the prescription. 
5. The software patient list will store the patient ID, prescription name, and count for 7 years.
6. The software shall not allow the pharmacist to refill a prescription that is out of date or out of refills. 
7. The software shall not allow the pharmacist to modify any details on the prescription.

3. Medication (including vitamins) and Medical Devices 
1. Order management and communication maintains usability of the system and ensures real-time sharing of order processing information as systems must provide accurate information such as delivery or availability time for a particular order. 
2. Accurate medical history as it relates to adverse reactions to drugs or other medications. 
3. Stability of the system is integral, as to fulfill an order without altering the integrity of the order or requiring additional information.

4. The system shall display in a manner conforming to ISO readability and accessibility standards.


 
Prevailing Regulations/Standards (NFR) for Pharmacy Software Systems: 
Non Functional Requirements are related not to how the system functions but defines how the system should perform. In the case of the pharmacy system it should follow the CGMP regulations enforced by the FDA. The key regulations that should be followed are as follows:  
1. Following the FDA approval process for marketing new drugs[4] 
2. Establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) standards for drug         
        
manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding[4] 
3. Specifying cGMP requirements for finished pharmaceutical products[4] 
4. Outlining cGMP for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) drugs[4] 
5. Addressing general regulations for biological products[4] 
 These rules ensure that the system has a confirmed identity, strength, quality, and ensures the purity of the drugs. 
 
Safety Concerns and Hazards: 
Some of the greatest safety concerns and hazards regarding pharmacy software systems are information security, reliability, and data integrity. Making sure patient information is secure is critical for pharmacy software considering how confidential patient records are. Similarly, reliability is another important concern for pharmacy software as they need to be available at all times, especially when the drugs being dispensed are essential for living, like insulin. Having too much downtime is simply not an option. Another safety concern with pharmacy software is making sure patient records remain intact. The system must accurately record and report the number of times a prescription has been refilled, especially for addictive drugs. Additionally, the system should never put a patient in a position where they can no longer refill a prescription or receive the wrong drugs due to a processing error on the system’s side.
